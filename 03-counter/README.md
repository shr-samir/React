# Counter Project

- Learned about how with the use of React, we can easily sync and update UI on state change all at once.
- Used `useState()` hook for updating of state of the counter on click of + or - button.
- `useState()` hook returns an array with two elements. In `useState()` hook, we declare a variable which holds the current state value and a function which update the state value.
- `useState()` hook only accepts single argument, which is the initial state value.
